<li>Introduction</li>
Alchemist was implemented using a model-view-controller design.  Although during the development process
(and even at the time I'm writing this) the project does not fully conform to the design, I have worked and 
will continue to work towards this.   Below are details about how this final project satisfies the 
semester project requirements.
<li>Requirements</li>
<ol class="alphastyle">
 <li>Game grid</li>
 Generated grid table with the grid(r,c) javacript function, stylized with CSS.
 <li>User input (forms)</li>
 Text input used to ask for player's name (defaults to 'the unknown alchemist').  Select used for choosing a 
 custom level on the 'Trust me...' page.  Buttons are on the level choice page, high score page, and the custom
 level page.  (Note, when I say 'page', I mean a div popup.)
 <li>User input (mouse clicks)</li>
 Click events are added to all grid tiles, the waste square, plus all buttons or div/text links that change a
 part of the game.
 <li>DHTML using innerHTML or DOM functions</li>
 Name is added to the game page depending on what name you give it.  Score, level, and rank are changed based on
 the game states.
 <li>XMLHttpRequest for JSON or HTML</li>
 XMLHttpRequest loads a default high score file if none is found in localStorage.
 <li>HTML5 audio tags, ..., localStorage</li>
 Audio tags used for sound effects.  localStorage is used for saving/loading a game state and high scores.
 <li>Game logic code</li>
 Game logic is fully implemented.  There may be changes to point values in the future, but this is merely cosmetic.
</ol>
<li>Future work</li>
I plan to work on the styling of the game (some of the current design is pretty tacky), as well as code clean-up
 and point distribution.
