  <li>State of the Game</li>
  <p>The current state of the game is almost playable for fun.  Basic tile logic 
  is in place, although there are a few bugs and there are no transition between levels.
  The start of the game is implemented, although I want to include a tutorial 
  at some point.  A debug pane has been added, which can be switched off later; for now
  it just reports whatever debug info I tell it (click events, state changes).
  </p>
  <p>Below is a more detailed list of the game logic state.</p>
  <ul class="minilist">
  <li>Randomized tiles: </li> tiles are randomly chosen (color, type) and displayed 
  on the next item area.
  <li>Tile placement logic: </li> wildcards can go next to any other tile; bombs can
  replace any placed tile; other tiles must match the surrounding tiles by color or
  type; these conditions are exclusive, meaning that unless you have a clean board, 
  you cannot place a tile in an unsurrounded space.
  <li>Bomb tile: </li> Bomb tiles will replace the placed tile (not gold or lead) with
  a gold tile.
  <li>Wildcard tile: </li> wildcard cannot be thrown away.
  <li>Row completion: </li> not yet implemented.
  <li>Board completion: </li> not yet implemented.
  <li>Level advancement: </li> not yet implemented.
  <li>Rank advancement: </li> not yet implemented.
  <li>New tiles/colors: </li> goes iwht level advancement, not implemented.
  <li>Scoring: </li> partially implemented; only tiles give points.
  <li>End game condition: </li> will report if you lose the game in debug, but no 
  other notification.
  <li>Waste: </li> state will advance and will end game at state 4.  Will increase or
  decrease depending on tile placement or tile discard.  Other conditions based on row
  or board completion not implemented.
  </ul>
  <li>Update, Assignment 5</li>
  <p>All game logic is implemented.  There is an issue with choosing a custom level (can 
  validly select the first option) which will be fixed in next update.  Future
  work includes: </p>
  <ul class="minilist">
  <li>High score board</li>
  <li>Tutorial</li>
  <li>Controls for controlling sound/music</li>
  <li>General Model/View clean up</li>
  <li>Custom grid size (dev side & for level 30+)</li>
  <li>Music???</li>
  <li>Mobile adaptation???</li>
  </ul>
  </ol>
